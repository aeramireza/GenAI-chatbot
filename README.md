# Rule-Based and NLP Financial Chatbot with EDA
This repository is from a job simulation involving AI-powered financial chatbot development for BCG's GenAI Consulting team, in which I integrated and interpreted complex financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports, and created a simple rule-based chatbot prototype that provides user-friendly financial insights and analysis.
* The CSV files contain a summary of some important financial figures found in the last three 10-K documents (publicly shared on the SEC's EDGAR Database (https://www.sec.gov/search-filings) corresponding to the last three fiscal years for Microsoft, Tesla and Apple.
* The EDA_Micro_Tesla_Apple.ipynb notebook contains an exploratory data analysis of this summary, performed to understand the type of information the chatbot is required to retrieve.
* The rule_based_chatbot.ipynb notebook contains the chatbot prototype coded with rule-based logic, some tests and comments on how it can be used and the information it can provide to the user.
* The NLP_chatbot.ipynb notebook contains the chatbot prototype coded with an NLP model using the libraries spaCy and thefuzz. Also some tests and comments.
